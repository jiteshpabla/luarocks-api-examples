# luarocks-api-examples

This repository contains some simple examples for running the functions of the Luarocks API present in the [luarocks-api](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/tree/luarocks-api) branch.

The luarock-api branch is currently under development so these examples may not work flawlessly. If you come across any issues with the API please report them directly to the luarocks [issue tracker](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/issues).
